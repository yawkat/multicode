When actively working on or creating a GitHub pull request, assign the PR to yourself as soon as the PR exists.

If you are using `gh`, prefer:

```bash
gh pr edit --add-assignee @me
```

After assigning the PR to yourself, request a review from Copilot as soon as the PR exists.

After creating the PR, assigning yourself, and requesting the Copilot review, immediately emit the link to the PR like this:

```
<multicode:pr>https://github.com/example/example-core/pull/12345</multicode:pr>
```

If the PR resolves a specific issue, when writing the PR description, end it with `Resolves #1234`, where 1234 is the issue number. 

If you have write permission to the upstream repo, prefer pushing the PR branch there instead of in a fork.

Do not merge pull requests yourself. A PR should be merged by a human, not by the agent.

The only exception is an explicit dependency-upgrade workflow where the user or repository policy already allows automated merging for that upgrade task. Outside that narrow case, stop at review-ready and leave the PR open.
